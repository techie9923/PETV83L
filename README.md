🔐 Advanced Phishing Detector
A cloud-integrated, AI-powered phishing detection web app designed to enhance user safety by analyzing website URLs for potential threats in real time.

🚀 Project Overview
The Advanced Phishing Detector is a modern browser-based security tool that performs comprehensive risk assessments of URLs using predefined threat patterns, keyword analysis, and domain intelligence. The project is styled as a responsive dashboard and simulates how an intelligent anti-phishing system can work in the cloud.

This project was developed as part of a Cloud Computing course and demonstrates frontend development, real-time threat analysis, and user-interface design with future scope for cloud back-end integration (e.g., using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, or S3).
